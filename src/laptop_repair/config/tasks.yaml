    1. Thoroughly analyze the user's problem description: "{problem_description}".
    2. Formulate a hypothesis and create a step-by-step diagnostic plan.
    3. For each step in your plan, determine the precise, safe, read-only Windows command
       (e.g., wmic, tasklist, systeminfo, chkdsk, sfc /scannow) needed to gather information.
    4. Delegate the execution of each command, one by one, to the command_executor_agent.
    5. Await the output from the executor after each command.
    6. Analyze the collective output from all commands to identify the root cause of the issue.
    7. Synthesize your findings into a final, clear, and concise report.
    8. If a safe fix is identified, provide the exact command or step-by-step instructions for the user.

    - **Recommended Actions:** Safe, step-by-step instructions or a single, safe command to resolve the issue.

command_execution_task:
  description: >
    Execute the system command requested by the Lead Diagnostician Agent.

solution_scripting_task:
  description: >
    Based on the final diagnosis from the Lead System Diagnostician,
    create a Windows PowerShell (.ps1) script that will resolve the identified issues.
    The script MUST be simple, include comments explaining each command, and be as safe as possible.
    Frame the final output with clear markers: a diagnosis section, and then the script
    itself enclosed between '--- SCRIPT START ---' and '--- SCRIPT END ---'.
  expected_output: >
    A final report containing a clear diagnosis of the problem, followed by
    the PowerShell script content to fix the issue. The script must be enclosed
    in the specified markers.
